# Lake Calculator

The solution to the following problem. It includes unit tests.

The app should work on any device with iOS 7.1+.

## Problem Statement:

We have a hypothetical tropical island with a mountain range. The mountain range gets flooded every time there is rain and we would like to calculate how much water accumulates within the mountains.

The island in question is a 2D island with rectangular peaks. (Example is README.png)

Our goal is to create an Objective-C class that exposes a method with the following input/output.

Please add unit tests as you see fit and wrap this class into a sample iOS application that allows user to interact with this method (I.e. Display the calculation).

## Input:

NSArray of NSNumbers (Floats) with heights. The array is ordered.

## Output:

NSNumber â€“ the sum of all water that did not run off. (Green shaded area in README.png).
